This file explains how each feature is preprocessed for this specific combination of data.
(Things might need to change once we incorporate more data when testing/training the dataset.
Right now it is mainly focused at data visualization)

primaryid: dropped as only use is merging data together
case_idx: no preprocessing needed
caseversion: dropped as it is a constant feature
event_dt: dropped as it is a date
event_dt_num: Dropped as same information as event_dt
mfr_dt/mfr_dt_num: dropped as it is a constant feature
init_fda_dt/init_fda_num: dropped as we do not care about dates
fda_dt/fda_dt_num: dropped for same reason above
mfr_sndr: dropped as it is a constant field
lit_ref: dropped as it is an empty field
age: TODO: binned into groups of [0-10), [10-20) and so on
age_cod: Dropped as just states year
age_grp: Dropped because it is empty
sex: 0 for F, 1 for Male
wt: TODO: Fill NaN and convert all lbs to kgs
wt_cod: Use to determing unit of measure and then drop
rept_dt: Dropped because of date
occp_cod: enumerate values
reporter_coutnry: enumerate country
ocr_country: dropped as empty feature
occp_cod_num: same values as occp_cod so drop
caseid_y: no preprocessing needed
drug_seq: none needed
role_cod: enumerate
drugname: enumerate
prod_ai: enumerate
val_vbm: drop as it only tells us information about how drug info was recorded
route: enumerate, fill NaN
dose_vbm: Dropped as more specific features coming up
cum_dose_chr/cum_dose_unit: drop as empty features
dechal: enumerate
rechal: enumerate
Lot_num: enumerate
exp_dt: drop as it is a date
nda_num: dropped as it is not relevant with our needs
dose_amt: enumerate
dose_unit: enumerate (might need to weight this?)
dose_form: enumerate
dose_freq: enumerate (might need to weight this)
caseid_x: drop this (duplicate)
rpsr_cod: enumerate
caseid_y: drop this (duplicate)
dsg_drug_seq: dropped as used for linking
start_dt, start_t_num, end_dt, end_dt_num: dropped
dur: dropped (this field involves therapy)
dur_cod: dropped because we dropped dur
caseid: keep this and drop all caseid_x and caseid_y
indi_drug_seq: dropped for data visualization as it is used for linking
preffered_term: enumerate



Note: enumerate means enumerating in alphabetical order
Note: Replaced nan with -1.
